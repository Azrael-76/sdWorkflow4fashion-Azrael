Known as "Neon Shroud," this establishment is a haven for the city's eclectic mix of hackers, mercenaries, corporate drones, and digital drifters.

From the outside, Neon Shroud is unassuming, its entrance marked by a pulsating holographic sign that flickers with the silhouette of a coyote, the bar's unofficial mascot. The facade is an amalgamation of retrofitted scrap metal and salvaged doors, a testament to the improvisational architecture that defines the city.

Upon entering, visitors are immediately enveloped by a symphony of electronic beats and the hum of conversation, punctuated by the occasional whir of a cybernetic limb. The air is thick with the scent of synthetic incense and the tang of ozone, a byproduct of the numerous neon signs and advanced tech scattered throughout the space.

The interior is a labyrinthine collection of rooms and alcoves, each with its own theme and mood. The main bar area is dominated by a long counter made of reclaimed circuit boards and resin, lit from beneath with a soft, pulsating glow. Bartenders with augmented reality visors mix cocktails that glow with bioluminescent ingredients, serving drinks named after infamous viruses and hacking exploits.
